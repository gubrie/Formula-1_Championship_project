This project provides a comprehensive analysis of historical racing data, offering insights into driver performance, constructor achievements, race outcomes, and long-term trends across multiple seasons. The dashboard was designed to make complex datasets accessible, engaging, and easy to explore through clear visual storytelling.


ðŸ”¹ Data & Modeling

âž£ Data sourced from an open dataset containing one fact table and four dimension tables: Drivers, Constructors, Circuits, and Races.

âž£ Implemented a star schema to optimize relationships and streamline querying.

âž£ All data transformations were performed with Power Query, ensuring clean, structured, and analysis-ready datasets.

âž£ A data model diagram is included in the repository.


ðŸ”¹ Dashboard Features

âž£ The dashboard is designed for interactive exploration of a large-scale historical racing dataset.

âž£ Overview Page: General KPIs (circuits, constructors, drivers, races, seasons) and a world map of circuit locations.

âž£ Driver Performance Page: Highlights top-performing drivers and Grand Prix winners.

âž£ Constructor Performance Page: Analyzes top constructors, race wins, and victories across different events.

âž£ Race Analysis Page: Includes pit stop analysis, Top 5 failures (donut chart), and time-series trends.

âž£ Custom Filter Panel for cross-dimensional filtering.

âž£ Dynamic Tooltips and Navigation Buttons for enhanced interactivity.


ðŸ”¹ DAX Measures

Multiple DAX formulas and calculated measures were created to derive deeper insights, enrich visualizations, and enable advanced-level analysis.
